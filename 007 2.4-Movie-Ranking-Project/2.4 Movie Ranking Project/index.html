  Learning a language is an active process where individuals acquire the ability
  to understand, speak, read, and write a new language by immersing themselves
  in its structure, vocabulary, and grammar rules, typically through exposure to
  native speakers, practice, and conscious study, allowing them to communicate
  effectively in that language across different contexts.
